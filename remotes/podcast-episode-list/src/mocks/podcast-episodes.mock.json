      "description": "In 1973, before their ascent to rock superstardom with Fleetwood Mac, Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks were just two young lovers making music in Los Angeles. Their debut album, Buckingham Nicks, though commercially unsuccessful at the time, would prove to be the catalyst that changed their lives. When Mick Fleetwood happened to walk into Sound City Studios and overheard Buckingham's masterful guitar work, he knew he'd found what his band desperately needed given the departure of their guitarist Peter Green. Fleetwood invited Buckingham to join the group, and Buckingham agreed on one condition: his musical and romantic partner, Stevie Nicks, would come too. This fateful meeting would birth the legendary lineup that created Fleetwood Mac and Rumours, albums that would define a generation.\n\nYet all this time, the band's origin story, captured in Buckingham Nicks, has remained locked away in aging vinyl archives – until now. Grammy-winning guitarist Madison Cunningham and virtuoso multi-instrumentalist Andrew Bird have breathed new life into this historic recording with their interpretation, Cunningham Bird. Cunningham, celebrated for her sophisticated fingerpicking and intricate compositions, joins forces with Bird, whose distinctive violin work and plaintive vocals have earned him critical acclaim.\n\nTheir reimagining of this pivotal album offers fresh insight into both Fleetwood Mac's enduring influence and the rocky romance that sparked their success. I sat down with the duo to discuss their approach to this legendary material and what drew them to resurrect these long-lost songs. Switched On Pop spoke with Madison Cunningham and Andrew Bird about how they adapted Buckingham Nicks into Cunningham Bird\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",

      "description": "Over the summer, the culture was shaken by the biggest rap beef this decade, between Drake and Kendrick Lamar. From “First Person Shooter” to “Not Like Us,” hip-hop listeners hung on each rapper’s every word and rebuttal, and for the first time in years, the genre felt exciting.\nMonths after the beef had “ended,” Lamar released a track on Instagram dubbed “Watch the Party Die,” in which he lamented that hip-hop, in its current state, has lost its way and – as the title suggests – needs to die. It’s interesting, coming from Lamar, the supposed winner of the beef, and begs the question: is hip-hop dead? \nOn this episode of Switched On Pop, engineer Brandon McFarland takes us on a journey over the course of history, to answer the question: can hip-hop ever truly die? And if this form of it is not sustainable, what’s next? \n\nTracklist:\nDrake - First Person Shooter ft. J.

      "description": "Stevie Wonder may be our modern day Mozart. A child prodigy, he joined Motown as a preadolescent where he was marketed as “Little” Stevie Wonder. He wowed audiences with his virtuosic command of the piano, harmonica, drums and of course, vocals. At just 13, he had his first number one hit “Fingertips Part II.” It was an unusual chart topper, featuring a live recording of mostly improvised music with Wonder switching between instruments as the audience cheered him on. But Wonder’s musical potential was far more than a gimmick. \n\nIn the 1970s, Wonder broke free from the confines of his initial recording contract, securing his artistic and financial freedom. Between 1971 and 1976, during what is now known as his \"classic period,\" he released five of the most iconic albums in popular music, beginning with Music of My Mind and culminating in Songs in the Key of Life. These albums showcased his musical genius and included timeless songs that have become part of the modern pop canon, touching on themes of love, heartbreak, justice, and spirituality. Few child prodigies fulfill their potential as profoundly as Stevie Wonder.\n\nWith the help of Wesley Morris, NYT critic and host of the spectacular audio series The Wonder of Stevie, Switched on Pop looks back on some of Stevie Wonder’s strongest compositions, exploring what makes him our contemporary musical maestro.\n\nSongs Discussed:\n\nStevie Wonder - \"Girl Blue\"\n\nStevie Wonder - \"Superwoman (Where Were You When I Needed You)\"\n\nStevie Wonder - \"Superstition\"\n\nStevie Wonder - \"Golden Lady\"\n\nStevie Wonder - \"Isn't She Lovely\"\n\nStevie Wonder - \"I Wish\"\n\nStevie Wonder - \"Sir Duke\"\n\nStevie Wonder - \"As\"\n\n\nLearn more about your ad choices.

From bubblegum pop to EDM, trap, and K-pop, we explore how the sound of pop has continually evolved—even when it feels like it’s all the same. Plus, we pull back the curtain on the show with a special interview: Sean Rameswaram, host of Vox's Today Explained, puts Nate and Charlie in the hot seat to reveal their best—and most cringe-worthy—moments from the past decade.\nLearn more about your ad choices.

Yet, despite their global success, they've often been a critical punching bag. The New York Times once branded them “the most insufferable band of the decade.” The Independent described them as “pompous, mawkish, and unbearably smug.” But Coldplay has never claimed to be the hardest rock band—they’ve instead built a legacy on their softer sound and uplifting message. With the release of their 10th studio album, Moon Music, we dive deep into their catalog and ask the question: can we learn to love Coldplay?\nLearn more about your ad choices.

Everybody has had a riff or a melody stuck in their head, but not at this . Eloise, a journalist and music writer, decided to turn her malady into a story. Her pursuit of the science behind \"stuck songs\" led her to our unique bureau of forensic musicology.\nOn this episode of Switched on Pop, Charlie and Nate talk about earworms: what they are, why are they so catchy, and how we might get rid of them. Then, Nate confronts his own stuck song: The Lemon Twigs's \"In My Head,\" and in talking to the two brothers behind the group, finds a novel approach to giving an unwanted musical guest the boot.\n\nSongs Discussed\n\n\nFall Out Boy - It’s Hard to Say “I Do,” When I Don’t\n\n\nThe Lemon Twigs - In My Head\n\n\nKylie Minogue - Can’t Get You Out of My Head\n\n\nGene Wilder - Pure Imagination\n\n\nDave Harrington Group - Pure Imagination\n\n\nMore\n\nRead Marianne Eloise’s Vulture article, “My Quest to Exterminate an Earworm”\n\nCatch the Lemon Twigs on Tour (at your own peril)\n\n\nLearn more about your ad choices.

      "description": "Oasis, the Manchester band led by brothers Noel and Liam Gallagher, conquered the charts in the 1990s with rock anthems like \"Wonderwall.\" This month, they did something no one saw coming: Announced a reunion. In 2025, the band will play 19 dates in five cities across the UK and Ireland, their first shows with both brothers in the lineup since breaking up in 2009 due to long-simmering tensions between them.\nFormed in 1991 with Noel as chief songwriter and guitarist and Liam as lead vocalist, the band helped define the sound of Britpop alongside peers like Blur, Suede, and Pulp. Noel’s and Liam’s feuding made it seem like the band would never reunite, so this upcoming tour has generated a minor frenzy, resulting in insane ticket prices, the band’s songs surging in popularity on streaming services, and countless diehard fans zipping up their parkas in anticipation. \nAs two casual listeners to the band, we want to understand the hype behind this long-awaited reunion, so we went through the band’s catalog to uncover what makes this working-class Mancunian outfit so beloved, and see whether we can learn to love Oasis.\n\nSongs Discussed\nOasis - Wonderwall, Supersonic, Shakermaker, Don't Look Back In Anger, Champagne Supernova, All Around The World, Go Let It Out, Stop Crying Your Heart Out, Little By Little, The Turning\nThe New Seekers - I'd Like to Teach the World to Sing (In Perfect Harmony)\nJohn Lennon - Gimme Some Truth, #9 Dream\nSheryl Crow - If It Makes You Happy\nLearn more about your ad choices.

      "description": "Porter Robinson has a unique relationship with being famous. With his new record SMILE! :D, the 32 year old producer and DJ steps front and center into the spotlight for the first time in his career, working through his thoughts on fame in the process — something he says he’s “addicted” to.\nThe first track on the record, “Knock Yourself Out XD,” is a hook-laden radio pop hit destined to sit on a neon green iPod shuffle, filled with chiptuned synth textures and tongue-in-cheek lyrics about what it means to contend with nuclear levels of celebrity. Robinson’s voice is also front and center, unencumbered by the vocal manipulation and heavy production defining his two previous albums. “”Knock Yourself Out XD” was me indulging that fantasy of like, This is so not a Porter Robinson song. Everyone's gonna hate this,” he said. “But this is what seems really fun to me right now.”\nThe rest of SMILE! :D juggles two truths about Robinson: his innate desire for a positive relationship with the culture that surrounds him, and his dark, introspective nature, highlighted on tracks with stark names like “Is There Really No Happiness?”. But “Knock Yourself Out XD” is deeply silly – filled with cheeky lyrics like the line “Bitch, I’m Taylor Swift.”\nIt’s new territory for him, but Robinson’s inclinations are, always, to “burn everything down and start fresh.” \nLearn more about your ad choices.

This oddity from two beloved legacy artists may be more than a stand alone hit hit to promote Mars' Vegas residency and Gaga's upcoming film role in Joker: Folie à Deux. \"Die With A Smile\" more than hints at being interwoven to that film's universe, while also adhering to a forgotten musical traditional: the devotional duet in the style of Sonny & Cher. In the movie, Joker and Gaga's character Harley Quinn, have shared musical delusions about performing in a murderous Sonny & Cher like TV duo.

      "description": "Few pop groups are making music as imaginative as Magdalena Bay. The Los Angeles-based duo of singer Mica Tenenbaum and multi-instrumentalist Matthew Lewin, have been steadily releasing music since 2016, eventually breaking out with their viral hit “Killshot,” four years later. In the last four years, their work has dabbled in everything from 70’s disco-pop to Y2K pastiche. Their music, often narrative-based and paired with equally stunning visuals, excels in balancing tension; there’s gossamer-sounding production juxtaposed with dark, conceptual lyrics, or chaotic cacophony placed alongside ironic euphoria.\n\nTheir sophomore album Imaginal Disk is out today, and is no exception. The record is a concept album of sorts, as it follows the story of a character named True, after receiving a “consciousness upgrade” in the form of the titular “imaginal disk.” Over the course of fifteen songs, Tenenbaum and Lewin tell a story about identity, technology, and what it means to be a human. \n\nIt’s a lofty record, so Switched On Pop’s Reanna Cruz sat down with Magdalena Bay to talk about how this album manages to sound so gorgeous — and took some cues from ABBA in the process.\nLearn more about your ad choices.

      "description": "If you've spent any time on the internet this summer, you may have encountered a certain refrain accompanying particularly fierce dance videos—\"I've been a nasty girl. Nasty, nasty, nasty.\" This track, \"Nasty\" by the R&B singer and songwriter Tinashe, is a jam in its own right. Far from just a piece of viral content, \"Nasty\" is one of the songs of the summer, a chance for an burgeoning artist to reach a new level of success, and the latest in a long line pop songs from Janet Jackson to Beyoncé and Destiny's Child, taking the term \"nasty\" and spinning its on its head. \n\"Nasty\" is also a song that, in some ways, is ridiculously simple. And the simplicity of pop music has been in the news after a new scientific study argued that pop hits have become less complex over time. We dig into the study's methodology to see if we agree with its conclusion, or to put it another way, whether its conclusions match our freak.\n\nSongs Discussed \nTinashe - Nasty, Save Room For Us, 2 On\nCharli XCX - I might say something stupid\nJanet Jackson - Nasty\nDestiny's Child - Nasty Girl\nAriana Grande - Nasty\nPaul Simon - Still Crazy After all These Years\n\nMore\nRead more from the New York Times about the study exploring pop's melodic complexity through history.\nLearn more about your ad choices.

      "description": "On June 17 the pop world was rocked by three letters: LOL. Kesha tweeted the acronym immediately after Katy Perry announced her new single \"Woman's World,\" which was co-written by Dr. Luke. Since Kesha had accused Dr. Luke of sexual assault a decade earlier, many read her \"LOL\" as directed at her one-time friend Perry. Kesha, meanwhile, released her own single a week before Perry's, a wild \"Joyride\" featuring hyperactive accordion, percussive handclaps, and quasi-operatic vocals.\nBoth pop stars have much at stake with their new songs. For Kesha, it's her first independent release since finishing her multi album contract with Dr. Luke's record label. For Katy Perry, it's her attempt to reconquer the charts after her last attempt fizzled. On this episode, we listen closely to both songs to hear how each artist is navigating a pivotal moment in their career.\nSince we are talking about the changing eras of some of our biggest stars, we knew we had to speak to an expert on the subject: Tayla Parx, the singer and songwriter whose newest track \"Era\" considers the tension between letting the moment define you, or defining it yourself.\n\nSongs Discussed:\nKesha - Joyride, Tik Tok, Eat the Acid, Raising Hell, Praying\nKaty Perry - Womans World, I Kissed a Girl, California Gurls, Daisies\nLady Gaga - Born This Way\nMadonna - Express Yourself\nTayla Parx - Era\nLearn more about your ad choices.

This club record celebrating messiness, partying, and brutal honesty has created its own color (brat green), a viral meme generator, and even an unlikely political platform. When CharliXCX endorsed Kamala Harris for president, saying \"Kamala IS brat\", the album took on a larger culture significance. The pundit class rushed to explain what it means to be a brat. Countless ink has been spilled dissecting the artwork and semiotics of brat, but has everyone really listened to the music? Smack in the middle of brat summer, Switched On Pop breaks down the making and meaning of the most talked about album of the season.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
